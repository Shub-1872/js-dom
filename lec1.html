<!-- we will write the monitorevents(document) and to unomitor the event think about it
also remember that we will use the eventlistner -->

<!-- eventtarget is the interface and it will able to recieve the event and also it has eventlistner
and this eventlistner will tell me what to do after reciving te event -->
<!-- event target is an interface and the window is a global object -->

<!-- about the dom -->
<!-- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of 
the document,such as the elements,attributes,text -->
<!-- allowing developers to dynamically alter the content and appearance of a webpage.

about the eventlistner
Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as a user clicking a button or resizing the window
avaScript allows us to handle these events and execute code in response.
Bypassing the class names separated by whitespace, we can search for multiple class names.

using the syntax of the getElementbyid or someother we can get theem 
querySelector: returns the very first element within the document that matches the given selector. It only returns the element that matches with one of the specified CSS selectors, or a group of selectors.
querySelectorAll: returns a static NodeList of elements that matches with one or a group of selectors. If no element matches, an empty NodeList is returned.
returns all elements in an array form that match the given CSS selector.

using the inner html allows you to read or update both the structure and content and structure of elements. 
to set the text orupdate the text content on the page of the html we will 
use the .innerhtml,textcontent,innertext but we will prefer innertext,textcontent
and also themain differences between the inner html and the text content
Both innerText and textContent ignore HTML tags and treat them as part of a string. 
A key difference between the two is in how they treat the text. Using innerText returns the text as it appears on the 
screen. And using textContent returns text as it appears in the markup. 

the major differences between the inner text and the text content
Also, innerText reads content as it appears on screen, ignores hidden content, and observes formatting of text. But textContent reads content as it appears in the markup. This means it reads hidden content too.
But it also ignores formatting like whitespaces and line breaks when you are using it set content.


properties of the dom
On the other hand, DOM is the same HTML document, but in the object form, javascript easily accesses the object, and we can easily dynamically manipulate the web page's content
avaScript cannot understand HTML tags like p, h1 in HTML document, on the other hand DOM is the same HTML document but in object form, that's why JavaScript can easily understand objept p in DOM. It can easily access all
those objects by using different properties and methods.
important property of DOM structure models is a structural isomorphism. it means if they are used to represent the same document then 
they will create the same structure model with the same relationship and the objects.
the nodes in the above DOM structure do not represent a data structure; they represent objects which have functions and identities.
DOM is not part of the javascript language itself. Instead, it is a web API to build and manipulate the website. We can Easily access DOM with any programming language such as python because it's not only limited to javascript.

typecorrecion 

Type coercion is the process of converting value from one type to another (such as string to number, object to boolean, and so on).
Type coercion can be explicit and implicit.
When a developer expresses the intention to convert between types by writing the appropriate code, like Number(value), itâ€™s called explicit type coercion
a weakly-typed language, values can also be converted between different types automatically, and it is called implicit type coercion
these are the three tpyes of the conversion possible 
to string
to boolean
to number

event target 
the object which is triggring the event wi
The event.target property returns the HTML element that triggered an event so we can retrieve any associated property or attribute. Targeting anything implies aiming at it; in this case, we are aiming at a particular element to gain access to the properties connected to it
we will use the syntax of the event.target.textnode to get the text content


queryselectorALL
document.querySelectorAll('p') in JavaScript will retrieve a static NodeList of all <p> (paragraph) elements
present in the document at the time the method is called
